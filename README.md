<!--- https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/


add contact for indoor email-->

In this code pattern, we show how to integrate Apple Indoor Maps within TRIRIGA.

This is targeted towards TRIRIGA users to solve wayfinding issues throughout a building that impact their workplace experience. Apple Indoor Maps utlizizes your existing Wi-Fi network to enable GPS-level location accuracy throughout a given space.

When the user has completed this Code Pattern, they will understand how they can turn their existing floor plans into an interactive indoor experience with Apple Maps, all within their TRIRIGA instance.

# Components

  *  [IBM TRIRIGA](https://www.ibm.com/products/tririga).  Tririga delivers insightful solutions for intelligent real estate and facilities management.
  *  [Apple MapKit JS](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkitjs).  The Apple MapKit JS allows developers to embed interactive Apple maps, annotate points of interest, and perform geo-related searches.

1. The TRIRIGA version downloaded needs to support Polymer 1.0
2. Developers must have an Apple account and Apple ID to use any kits or code provide by Apple.  You can create an account</font> [here](https://appleid.apple.com/account?appId=632&returnUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.apple.com%2Faccount%2F#!&page=create).

# Prerequisites

  * [IBM TRIRIGA UX framework](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/IBM%20TRIRIGA1/page/UX%20Framework).   The IBM TRIRIGA Application Platform introduces an MVC-based UX framework for Polymer-based applications.  

  * [Polymer 1.0](https://polymer-library.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/feature-overview) library.  The Polymer library provides a set of features for creating custom elements.

  * [Polymer CLI](https://polymer-library.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/tools/polymer-cli).  The Polymer command line interface.

  * [Apple JWT Generator](https://github.com/addisonwebb/Apple-JWT-Generator).<font color="red"> This Python 3 script generates a Java Web Token (JWT) for map authorization from Apple.</font>

  * [Apple Maps](https://developer.apple.com/maps/web/).  Apple Maps brings interactive maps to your website â€” complete with annotations, overlays, and interfaces to Apple Maps services.

  * [Apple Indoor Maps](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/241/).  The Indoor Maps Program enables organizations with large public or private spaces to deliver user experiences that provide precise indoor location information and present stunning indoor maps.

  * [Apple Indoor Survey Tool](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/indoor-survey/id994269367).  Apple tool used to enable Apple Indoor Positioning in your venue.

  * [Safe FME Workbench](https://www.safe.com/)

  * [WebViewSync](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/groups/service/html/communityview?communityUuid=9e3a5b9d-6a06-4796-a6c1-5137b626e39c#fullpageWidgetId=W89a8af160e64_4167_a047_b5bc553dcaf4&folder=705ed044-fa9c-4d87-8353-3017fcd6f863).  Populate the HTML files and automatically sync your HTML changes in your TRIRIGA environment.

  * [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).  Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

# Team ID
team_id = 'ENTER TEAM ID'

# Key ID
key_id = 'ENTER KEY ID'

# Private Key
private_key = b'-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n \n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----'

issued_timestamp = time.time()
encoded = jwt.encode({'iss': team_id,'iat': issued_timestamp}, private_key, algorithm='ES256', headers={'kid': key_id})
```
## 8. Enable Wi-Fi Fingerprinting

Go to [Apple Business Register Indoor Maps Account](https://register.apple.com/indoor)

![Indoor Maps](images/Apple_bus.png)


Click "Add File" to upload your geojson files. This may take a couple tries. If you get errors you can go into the IMDF sandbox to fix the errors and reupload the files.

![Indoor Maps](images/upload_file2.png)


Once it is "Ready for Survey" download [Indoor Survey App for IOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/indoor-survey/).

![Indoor Maps](images/indoor_survey_app.png)


Open the app and survey the building. For help with surveying a building check out [Apple's help page](https://help.apple.com/indoorsurvey/).

![Indoor Maps](images/iPhone11_level1.png)


It will take up to 24 hours for the survey to be registered in the system. Once completed you will receive an email and be able to go into the survey app to test the indoor positioning.
