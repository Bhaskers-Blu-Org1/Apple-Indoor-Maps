<!--- https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ -->

In this code patter, we show how to do this

this is to help tririga users

in the end they'll have this 

insert image of apple maps in tririga

# Components
tririga vm

apple developer account

# Prerequisites

tririga ux framework

polymer 1.0

python 3 (github link to main.py for generating jwt)

apple maps other videos

indoor survey tool

safe fme (workbench) (contact dave)

webview (.jar file)

# Steps

Follow these steps to setup and run this Code Pattern

Steps for dinosaur map, step for custom maps
(can have 1.1 and 1.2 to differentiate)

1. Download Tririga vm that uses Polymer 1.0 components
1. Download Polymer 1.0 library
1. Webview to sync tririga code(put in all the commands.. init, sync)
1. Download code from github and put into TRIRGA folder
1. Push new code using webview to tririga server
1. Convert autocad floor plans to IMDF geojson with Safe FME workbench (not needed for dino demo, floor plans already there, needed for custom)
1. Apple developer account created private key created for jwt token
1. Load geojson floor plans to be validated and georeferenced
1. Indoor survey tool and survey building for bluedot accuracy
1. Put in new georeferenced geojson files in venue folder

If using custom maps, modify venue folder to hold your files
